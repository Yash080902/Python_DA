    "> * Option 2: Take a 10-year loan with an interest rate of 8% (compounded monthly) for the entire amount.\n",

    "Since we need to compare the EMIs for two loan options, defining a function to calculate the EMI for a loan would be a great idea.  The inputs to the function would be cost of the house, the down payment, duration of the loan, rate of interest etc. We'll build this function step by step.\n",
