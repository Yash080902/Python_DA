### Changes Made:
- Adjusted the heading hierarchy for better readability (`#` for main heading, `##` for subheadings).
- Organized each section (`Arithmetic Operations`, `Data Types`, `Variables`, `Important Questions & Operations`) under clear headings with bullet points.
- Formatted code snippets and commands within Markdown code blocks for clarity.
- Ensured consistent language and formatting throughout the README.

This revised version should serve as a clear and informative README file for your Python for Data Analysis series.
